# 1 Problem Statement
As a new developer, it may be daunting to work on existing codebases. They want to practice writing new pull requests to existing repositories, but are unsure of how to do so. Sometimes, they need a tool to help them practice writing PRs base on other people's existing successful PRs.

The saas aim to solve this problem by providing a simple search tool to find PRs that have already been merged and closed to practice on. Additionally, it provides steps to start working on the PR, hints on how to fix the issues based on your current commits and the original commits. When the user is satisfied with the iteration on the forked repo, they can get perform a check in which an AI will review the user code with the original code and provide suggestions on how to improve the code.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 2 Architecture

As this project is a simple Saas that uses GitHub Search API and OpenAI API, and there is no persistent data, there is no backend.

The frontend is build on ReactJS. There are 2 pages in the front end; the search page that users can find completed merged PRs to practice on, and the Issue Page that users can check their code against the original code.

## 2.1 Search Page
<img src="/daigrams/search_page_flow.png" height="600" display="block">


*Figure 1: Search Page Flow*


In the search page, users can search for PRs that have been merged and closed. The user can enter a keyword to search for PRs that are related to the keyword. The user can also select the language of the PRs to filter the results.

The Search Page, built as a React component, offers a streamlined interface where users can authenticate with their GitHub Personal Access Token, enabling access to the GitHub Search API with increased rate limits. Once authenticated, users can:

- **Search for Issues:**  
    Enter keywords, select programming languages, or specify repositories to filter closed issues with merged pull requests. The search query dynamically incorporates these parameters along with a filter for relevant PRs.

- **View Results:**  
    The interface lists issues with details, such as:
    - Title with a direct GitHub link
    - Issue number, repository name, and associated labels (color-coded)
    - A brief, truncated description
    - The count of associated pull requests
    - An estimated change complexity (e.g., "Trivial < 10 lines")

- **Practice Contributions:**  
    A "Practice This Issue" button for each issue opens a dedicated page, allowing users to simulate contributing by solving issues based on real-world examples.

## 2.2 Issue Page

<img src="/daigrams/issue_page_flow.png" height="600" display="block">


*Figure 2: Issue Page Flow*


The Issue Page provides an interactive environment for users to practice solving real GitHub issues and receive feedback on their solutions. It is composed of two main panels: Practice Instructions and PR Review Panel.

The Issue Page is made up of two main panels: the Practice Instructions panel and the PR Review panel. This design allows users to practice solving real GitHub issues while receiving feedback on their solutions.

### Practice Instructions Panel
The Practice Instructions panel guides users through the process of forking a repository, cloning it, and preparing their environment for coding. It includes the following features:
- **Step-by-step Workflow:**  
  Users are guided through the process of forking the repository, cloning it, checking out the commit before the fix, and creating a new branch for their solution.
- **Files Changed & Hints:**
    The panel lists the files changed in the original PR, with the number of additions and deletions, helping users focus on relevant parts of the codebase. Users can also view hints, such as the number of commits and files changed in the original solution.
- **Additional infomation:**
    The panel provides additional information about the issue, including the title, description (rendered with markdown), labels, repository, and any associated comments. It also lists all pull requests that have been merged to resolve the issue, including their titles, numbers, and descriptions.

### PR Review Panel
The PR Review panel allows users to compare their solution with the original pull request and receive feedback. It includes the following features:
- **Repository and Commit Comparison:**  
    Users can input their forked repository and a commit SHA to compare their solution with the original PR using GitHubâ€™s compare API.
- **Automated Hints:**
    The panel can generate up to three AI-powered hints, each becoming more specific, to help users align their solution with the original PR.
- **AI Code Review:**
    After comparing their code, users can request an AI-generated review. The AI provides a concise assessment, specific feedback, and suggestions for improvement, referencing the original PR.

- **User Experience:**  
  The Issue Page is designed to be informative and supportive, providing clear instructions, actionable hints, and constructive feedback. It encourages learning by allowing users to iteratively improve their solutions and compare them with real-world PRs.

**Workflow Summary:**
1. User selects an issue to practice.
2. The page loads the issue details, associated PRs, and comments.
3. The Practice Instructions panel guides the user through forking, cloning, and preparing the repo.
4. The user implements their solution and pushes it to their fork.
5. In the PR Review Panel, the user compares their solution with the original, receives hints, and can request an AI review.
6. The user iterates on their solution based on feedback and hints.

This approach provides a hands-on, feedback-driven learning experience, closely simulating real open-source contribution workflows.

## 2.3 API Integration

The project leverages the GitHub REST API v3 via the Octokit JavaScript client and the OpenAI API to provide a rich, interactive learning experience:

- **GitHub API (via Octokit):**
  - Authenticates requests using a stored GitHub Personal Access Token.
  - Searches issues and pull requests with the `GET /search/issues` endpoint.
  - Retrieves detailed pull request information with `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}` to assess change complexity and gather file diffs.
  - Fetches associated comments, commit logs, and changed files for each PR to provide comprehensive context.
  - Ensures compatibility with the latest API features by setting the `X-GitHub-Api-Version` header.

- **OpenAI API:**
  - Integrates with the OpenAI API (using a user-provided API key) to generate AI-powered hints and code reviews.
  - In the PR Review Panel, users can request up to three progressively specific hints, each generated by prompting the OpenAI API with the context of the issue, the original PR diff, and the user's code changes.
  - After submitting their solution, users can request an AI-generated code review. The OpenAI API analyzes the differences between the user's implementation and the original PR, providing concise, constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

This dual integration ensures that practice material is always up-to-date, and that users benefit from both authentic code changes and personalized, AI-driven feedback to accelerate their learning.

# 4 Prompt Engineering and LLM Functions

A core feature of this project is the use of prompt engineering to generate context-aware hints and code reviews using the OpenAI API. The PR Review Panel is designed to guide users through improving their code by providing AI-generated feedback at different stages.

## 4.1 Progressive Hint Generation

The system generates up to three hints for each user submission. Each hint is created by sending a tailored prompt to the OpenAI API, which includes:
- The context of the GitHub issue and pull request
- A summary of the original PRâ€™s code changes
- The userâ€™s current code changes
- All previously generated hints

The prompt is dynamically adjusted based on the number of hints already provided:
- The first hint is vague and simple
- The second hint is more specific
- The third hint is very specific and actionable

This progressive approach helps users iteratively improve their solution without immediately revealing the full answer, simulating a real-world mentoring process.

## 4.2 AI Code Review

After the user submits their solution, the system sends another prompt to the OpenAI API to request a code review. This prompt includes the issue context, the original PRâ€™s code changes, and the userâ€™s code changes. The AI is instructed to provide a concise review, including an overall assessment, specific feedback, and suggestions for improvement, The prompt ensures the feedback is constructive and educational.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.3 Experimentation and Results

Through experimentation with prompt phrasing and structure, the system achieves a balance between helpfulness and challenge. By referencing both the original and user code, the AI delivers targeted feedback that is relevant to the userâ€™s progress. This demonstrates the effectiveness of prompt engineering in creating an interactive, scalable, and supportive learning environment for open-source contributions.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 5 Conclusion
