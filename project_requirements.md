Assignment 2 is Individual Submission by each student (not group work) who has two choices. Choose only one and submit a report (not more than five pages) written in Microsoft Word or Latex (https://www.overleaf.com/). You can use Notebook and attach it as Code in Appendix or convert into a readable PDF or Word document for upload.  

Choice 2: Study basics of API in Github and Code Search.

Github REST APIs: https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28. Tutorial of using Github API is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvfLavRD1Os or Github manual: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28. You may find that you need to know some Javascript (and, if not, all the more a good reason to learn Javascript and to learn from Mendel Rosenblum, Stanford professor and VMWare Founder from his Stanford course CS142:  https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs142/lectures.html).  First, show that you can use Github Search API to search for code/information in Github database: https://stateful.com/blog/github-search-api. Then, build a simple SaaS using your Github Search functionality.  Examples can be a Code Documentation Generator with simple LLM like WebGPT: https://github.com/0hq/WebGPT (e.g., query for a code and generate a description in natural language) or detecting AI-generated code (e.g., given a AI-generated code snippet, search for its related code with high similarities in Github repo). Your resport should have a section discussing how you explore prompt engineering and LLM functions in your SaaS.

Grading Criteria:

- Report presentation (30%). How well is your report written and presented? 

- Technical novelty  (40%). What have you uncovered from observations, thought experiments, analysis etc?

- Experimentation (30%). Are your experiments sound and scalable?  Are your codes readable and working correctly to generate figures/evidences to your analysis?
